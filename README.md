# JavaScript Type Coercion Bug

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to type coercion during addition. The `foo` function adds two values, but it doesn't handle cases where the inputs are not numbers, leading to unexpected results. The solution demonstrates how to properly handle these cases using type checking.
